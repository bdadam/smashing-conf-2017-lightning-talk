- First slide:
  - Throw in tools and tech words
  - Node.js, Php, Webpack, Grunt, Gulp, Rollup, npm, yarn, Mongo, Redis, Nginx, Apache, Imagemagick, Graphicsmagick, etc.

- How to work with all these technologies in different projects

- Dockerize all the things
- What is in a Dockerfile?
- Reproducible builds (same input always delivers the same results)

- docker-compose for local computer

- Record some terminal command runs

- Point out time savings
  - Switching between projects back and forth
  - No need to share database, configuration or runtime dependencies, everything is encapsulated
